            <br></br>
            <p>Our family farm has been engaged in certified organic grape cultivation and natural wine-making in the Badacsony wine region for over twenty years.
                Since a young age, I've been fascinated by viticulture and winemaking, so I joined my father, Sándor Tóth, in the life of the farm. </p>
            <p>We produce wines from numerous international and Hungarian white and red grape varieties, focusing on naturalness and the highest achievable quality.
                Currently, we cultivate eight hectares of land, where our dominant grape varieties include the classic Olaszrizling, Pinot Noir, Kékfrankos, and Zeusz.
                Our vineyards are located on the volcanic slopes of Köves-hegy, Hajagos, and Csobánc, where the unmistakable character of our soils—basalt—contributes to the minerality of our wines.
                We foster active soil life and higher biodiversity without using artificial fertilizers, herbicides, or systemic pesticides.</p>
            <p>
                The path of naturalness in our cellar techniques means minimal intervention, which we deepen year by year. We ferment spontaneously with terroir wild yeasts, and apart from minimal sulfur addition, no other additives find their way into our wines.
                Our goal is to produce natural wines. We employ tank, reductive technology alongside aging in oak barrels and pyrogranite amphorae.
            </p>

                In the winter of 2017, my wife and I made a significant commitment. In pursuit of closer harmony with nature, we moved to our cellar on Hosszú-hegy, where our youngest family member now grows up amidst the vineyard environment.
                In spring 2020, our wine terrace was completed.

                Alongside tasting our wines, we offer excellent panoramas to our visitors. A particular feature is our integration of viticulture with animal husbandry—our chickens scratch between the rows, and we practice tractor-less grazing.
                Hungarian hairy goats maintain our protective strips, and we make homemade cheese from their milk. Guests have the opportunity to get to know our animals.
            </p>
            <p>Our aim is to provide a comprehensive experience for the whole family in a peaceful, quiet environment free from urban noise.</p>
